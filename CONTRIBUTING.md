# CONTRIBUTING

This project is just a simple portage of works done the GitHub Community. First, the wordcloud rendering is done thanks to [worldcloud2.js](https://github.com/timdream/wordcloud2.js). Second, the integration of the latter in a React component is copied from [react-wordcloud2](https://github.com/Tarabyte/react-wordcloud2). Therefore, my work here is limited to the integration of these two into a component that can be used in [Dash](https://dash.plotly.com).

This project was generated by the [dash-component-boilerplate](https://github.com/plotly/dash-component-boilerplate) it contains the minimal set of code required to create your own custom Dash component.
